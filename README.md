# Staking Hub React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) using the React template. The UI and logic are migrated from the provided `index.html` file, with all custom JS and CSS integrated into React components and hooks. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view the app.

## Project Structure
- `src/App.jsx`: Main app component (migrated from index.html)
- `src/components/`: Major UI sections as React components
- `tailwind.config.js`: Tailwind CSS configuration

## Customization
- All UI logic and theming from the original HTML are preserved.
- Update or add components in `src/components/` as needed.
